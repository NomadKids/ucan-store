## 🏗️ Architecture

> **📊 For detailed visual diagrams and flow charts, see [ARCHITECTURE_FLOW.md](./docs/ARCHITECTURE_FLOW.md)**  
> Includes sequence diagrams for WebAuthn, Ed25519 keystore, delegation flows, and complete end-to-end scenarios with Mermaid visualizations.

### **WebAuthn DID (P-256)**
- Hardware-secured identity using device biometrics (Face ID, Touch ID, Windows Hello)
- P-256 elliptic curve cryptography (WebAuthn also supports Ed25519)
- DID format: `did:key:zDna...` (P-256 public key)
- Used for: Initial authentication, PRF seed derivation
- **Note**: Cannot sign UCANs due to WebAuthn signature format (see [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md))

### **Worker-Based Ed25519 Keystore**
- Ed25519 keypair generated in a dedicated web worker
- AES-GCM encryption key derived from WebAuthn PRF seed (deterministic)
- Private key never leaves the worker (see Security warnings)
- DID format: `did:key:z6Mk...` (Ed25519 public key)
- Used for: UCAN signing, Storacha client principal

**Worker Functions:**
- `init(prfSeed)` - Initialize AES key from WebAuthn PRF seed
- `generateKeypair()` - Generate Ed25519 keypair and archive
- `encrypt(plaintext)` - Encrypt data with AES-GCM
- `decrypt(ciphertext, iv)` - Decrypt data with AES-GCM
- `sign(data)` - Sign data with Ed25519 private key
- `verify(data, signature)` - Verify Ed25519 signature

### **Key Flow**
```
WebAuthn Credential (P-256)
    ↓
rawCredentialId (PRF seed)
    ↓
Worker: HKDF-SHA-256 → AES-GCM key
    ↓
Worker: Generate Ed25519 keypair
    ↓
Worker: Create Ed25519Signer archive
    ↓
Encrypt archive with AES key → localStorage
    ↓
Reconstruct Ed25519Signer for Storacha client
```

## 🚀 Features

### **1. Generate Ed25519 DID**
- Automatically generated on first authentication
- Derived from WebAuthn credential (deterministic per credential)
- Stored encrypted in localStorage
- Format: `did:key:z6Mk...`

### **2. Create Delegation (Storacha CLI)**
```bash
# On Storacha CLI, create delegation for your Ed25519 DID
storacha delegation create did:key:z6Mkwa35STKQF1i5eoDYtQ4W1y6y6NbE9RXe3QiJt7aSK6uS --base64
```

This outputs a base64-encoded UCAN delegation proof.

### **3. Import Delegation**
- Paste the delegation proof from Storacha CLI
- App verifies the delegation is for your current Ed25519 DID
- **Format auto-detection**: Supports multiple formats including:
  - `multibase-base64` (Storacha CLI format with 'm' prefix)
  - `multibase-base64url` (with 'u' prefix)
  - CAR format, JSON format, and other legacy formats
- Delegation stored in localStorage with detected format displayed
- Capabilities: `upload/*`, `store/*`, `blob/*`, `space/*`, etc.

### **4. Upload File**
- Drag & drop or click to select
- File uploaded to Storacha using delegation
- Returns CID (Content Identifier)
- Files stored on Filecoin network

### **5. List Files**
- Lists all uploads in your Storacha space
- Uses delegation with `upload/list` capability
- Shows CID, upload date, shards

### **5.5. Download via Helia (IPFS)**
- Spins up a browser Helia node to fetch files directly over IPFS
- Falls back to public gateways if Helia cannot fetch
- Thumbnails use the same Helia-first blob pipeline

### **6. Create Delegation**
- Create new delegations from your current Ed25519 DID
- Delegate to another DID with specific capabilities
- **Delegation chaining supported** - create sub-delegations from received delegations
- Expiration support (1 hour to 10 years, or never)
- Works with both Storacha credentials and received delegations

### **7. Revoke Delegations** 🆕
- **Revoke delegations you created** to immediately block access
- Integrated with Storacha's revocation registry
- **Real-time validation** - all operations check revocation status before executing
- **Visual indicators** - Clear UI badges showing Active/Revoked/Expired status
- **Automatic caching** - Revocation checks are cached for 5 minutes to minimize API calls
- **Security first** - Essential for handling lost devices, mistakes, or security incidents
- **Permanent action** - Revocations cannot be undone (by design)
- Works with both issuer and audience of delegations

**How it works:**
1. Click "Revoke" button on any delegation you created
2. Confirm the action (cannot be undone)
3. Revocation request sent to Storacha service
4. Delegation marked as revoked in local storage
5. Recipient can no longer use the delegation for uploads
6. Revocation status synced via `https://up.storacha.network/revocations/`

## 🔄 How It Works

### Serverless Architecture
- **100% browser-based** - No backend server required
- **Client-side only** - All cryptography happens in browser/web worker
- **Deployed to IPFS** - Static files served from decentralized storage
- **WebAuthn + UCAN** - Hardware-backed identity + decentralized authorization

### Browser A (Delegation Creator)
1. **Authenticate** with WebAuthn → Generate Ed25519 DID
2. **Add Storacha credentials** (key + proof) OR import delegation from CLI/another browser
3. **Create delegation** for Browser B's DID with selected capabilities
4. **Share delegation proof** (base64 string) with Browser B

### Browser B (Delegation Receiver)  
1. **Authenticate** with WebAuthn → Generate own Ed25519 DID
2. **Import delegation proof** from Browser A
3. **Upload/list/delete files** using delegated permissions
4. **No Storacha credentials needed** - operates entirely through delegated authority!

### Multi-Browser Delegation Chain
```
Storacha Console → Browser A → Browser B → Browser C
                    (creates   (re-delegates
                    delegation) to Browser C)
```

Each browser can create sub-delegations from received delegations, enabling flexible permission management across devices and users.

## 📦 Setup

### Prerequisites
- Modern browser with WebAuthn support
- Device with biometric authentication
- Storacha account and credentials (for creating delegations)

### Installation
```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Local In-Memory Storacha (3 terminals)
Use this when you want the local upload service + Helia preview flow. The
`storacha:memory` output includes a Helia multiaddr you should pass to the app.

**Terminal 1: local upload API + Helia**
```bash
npm run storacha:memory
```

**Terminal 2: web app pointed at local API**
```bash
VITE_UPLOAD_SERVICE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8787 \
VITE_UPLOAD_SERVICE_DID=did:web:test.up.storacha.network \
VITE_REVOCATION_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8787 \
VITE_HELIA_ADDRS=/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/PORT/ws/p2p/PEER_ID \
npm run dev:local
```

**Terminal 3: create a delegation (CLI or helper script)**
```bash
cd web
node scripts/test-local-delegation.js
```

Then paste the delegation proof into the app.
For more detail, see `docs/local-dev.md` (setup) and `docs/LOCAL_STORACHA_STATUS.md`
(status, Helia notes, troubleshooting).

## Aleph IPFS Deployment

The `Aleph PWA Deploy` workflow builds the static Vite app in `web/`, publishes
`web/dist` to Aleph IPFS, and can link a production domain for the PWA.

Required repository secret:

- `ALEPH_PRIVATE_KEY`: Ethereum private key used by the Aleph hosting action.

Recommended repository variables:

- `UCAN_STORE_PWA_DOMAIN`: custom frontend domain to attach to the Aleph site,
  for example `upload.example.com`.
- `UCAN_STORE_WEBSITE_NAME`: Aleph website identifier. Defaults to
  `ucan-store`.
- `UCAN_STORE_SERVICE_ORIGIN`: public origin of the paired upload-service VM,
  for example `https://upload-api.example.com`.
- `UCAN_STORE_SERVICE_DID`: DID of the paired upload-service VM.
- `UCAN_STORE_SERVICE_MANIFEST_URL`: optional explicit manifest URL. Use this
  when the PWA should read the manifest directly from the service domain.
- `UCAN_STORE_REVOCATION_URL`, `UCAN_STORE_REVOCATION_DID`, and
  `UCAN_STORE_RECEIPTS_URL`: optional runtime endpoints exposed to the app.
- `UCAN_STORE_SPACE_DID`: optional space/resource DID written into the static
  service manifest.
- `UCAN_STORE_ALLOWED_CAPABILITIES`: optional comma-separated capability list
  written into the static service manifest.
- `ALEPH_OWNER_ADDRESS`: optional Aleph owner address when deploying on behalf
  of another account.
- `ALEPH_RETENTION_DAYS`: optional cleanup window for older Aleph website
  versions.

When `UCAN_STORE_SERVICE_ORIGIN` and `UCAN_STORE_SERVICE_DID` are configured,
the workflow writes both `/.well-known/ucan-store.json` and
`/service-manifest.json` into the static bundle. The PWA can then resolve the
paired service from its own custom domain. If those variables are omitted, the
app still supports runtime discovery through `UCAN_STORE_SERVICE_MANIFEST_URL`
or the existing `VITE_*` fallback values.

## Aleph Upload-Service VM

The `Aleph Upload Service VM` workflow builds the `ucan-store` rootfs with the
shared `NiKrause/relay-button` tooling. On `main` pushes it publishes a fresh
rootfs when `local-storacha-api/`, the Aleph contract, or package lockfiles
change. Manual runs can also deploy a VM from the published image.

Required repository secrets for VM deploys:

- `ALEPH_PRIVATE_KEY`: Ethereum private key used to publish the rootfs and
  create the Aleph VM. The default workflow also derives the UCAN admin Ed25519
  key and root delegation proof from this key with relay-button's
  domain-separated `derive-from-aleph-private-key` mode.
- `VM_SSH_PUBLIC_KEY`: SSH public key installed into the VM unless the manual
  workflow input overrides it.

Optional repository secrets:

- `UCAN_STORE_BOOTSTRAP_JSON`: canonical bootstrap package containing the admin
  DID, service DID/origin binding, space DID, allowed capabilities, and root
  delegation proof. When set, this explicit package overrides automatic
  derivation.

Recommended repository variables:

- `UCAN_STORE_BOOTSTRAP_MODE`: bootstrap mode for VM deploys. Defaults to
  `derive-from-aleph-private-key`.
- `UCAN_STORE_SERVICE_DID`: public service DID, for example
  `did:web:upload-api.example.com`.
- `UCAN_STORE_SERVICE_ORIGIN`: public upload-service VM origin, for example
  `https://upload-api.example.com`.
- `UCAN_STORE_PWA_ORIGIN`: public PWA origin. If omitted, the workflow derives
  it from `UCAN_STORE_PWA_DOMAIN`.
- `UCAN_STORE_ALLOWED_CAPABILITIES`: comma-separated capability list included in
  the generated root delegation.
- `UCAN_STORE_ADMIN_DID`: optional manual admin DID hint. Automatic derivation
  emits the actual admin DID in the workflow summary.
- `ALEPH_VM_CRN_HASH`: optional target CRN hash for deployments.

The base VM profile exposes only `22/tcp`, temporary setup `80/tcp`, and public
HTTPS `443/tcp`. Public Helia/IPFS gateway exposure remains a later milestone.

## 🔐 Security

> **⚠️ READ FIRST**: Please review **[SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md)** for critical security warnings and attack vectors.

### 🚀 Future: Multi-Device DKG

A **planned version** will use **Distributed Key Generation (DKG)** across multiple devices (browser + mobile), where:
- No single device holds the complete private key
- Signing requires confirmation from multiple devices (e.g., scan QR code on mobile)
- Devices communicate via js-libp2p
- Hardware-backed security on all devices
- Enables secure credential storage on Storacha

See **[PLANNING.md](./PLANNING.md)** for the complete roadmap and technical details.

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### **Worker Keystore**
- Location: `web/src/workers/ed25519-keystore.worker.ts`
- Generates Ed25519 keypair using Web Crypto API
- Creates `@ucanto/principal/ed25519` compatible archive
- AES key derived deterministically from PRF seed

### **Secure Ed25519 DID**
- Location: `web/src/lib/secure-ed25519-did.ts`
- Wraps worker communication
- Provides `encryptArchive()` / `decryptArchive()` helpers
- Manages DID generation and storage

### **UCAN Delegation Service**
- Location: `web/src/lib/ucan-delegation.ts`
- Manages Storacha client initialization
- Handles delegation import/export
- Upload/list/delete operations

## 📝 Notes

- **Deterministic DID**: Same WebAuthn credential always produces same Ed25519 DID
- **Archive Encryption**: Archive encrypted with AES-GCM, decrypted only in worker
- **Delegation Mismatch**: If DID changes, delegation must be recreated
- **Worker Persistence**: Worker state lost on page reload; archive restored from localStorage
- **Delegation Chaining**: Can create sub-delegations from received delegations, enabling permission cascading across browsers/devices
- **Format Auto-Detection**: Uses ucanto `extract()` first (for app-created delegations), falls back to Storacha `Proof.parse()` (for CLI delegations), maintaining backward compatibility
- **Base64 Encoding Compatibility**: Handles both standard base64 (Storacha CLI) and base64url formats by detecting the multibase prefix ('m' or 'u') and normalizing accordingly. See [issue #590](https://github.com/storacha/upload-service/issues/590) for background on the encoding challenge.

### Why WebAuthn Can't Sign UCANs

WebAuthn (both P-256 and Ed25519) cannot produce raw signatures suitable for UCAN tokens due to the signature format specification. WebAuthn signs `authenticatorData || hash(clientDataJSON)` which includes origin, ceremony type, and other metadata - making signatures non-portable and incompatible with UCAN's requirement for raw cryptographic signatures.

See **[SECURITY.md § WebAuthn UCAN Signing](./SECURITY.md#-webauthn-ucan-signing-why-its-not-possible)** for detailed technical explanation.
